These are my solutions to various problems on Codeforces submitted over the years. I also put some solutions to https://cses.fi/problemset/, https://szkopul.edu.pl/ and LeetCode.
There are subfolders for problems that can be easily fitted into one. If problem is crossing from many categories i didn't put it into any directory.

You can read problem statement on 
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/{number}/{letter}
For example for 1660C you would go to:
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1660/C

For Szkopul there are files named Szkopul{name of the problem}.cpp, where first line contains link to the problem statement.
