These are my solutions to various problems on Codeforces submitted over the years.
There are subfolders for problems that can be easily fitted into one. If problem is crossing from many categories i didn't put it into any directory.

You can read problem statement on 
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/{number}/{letter}
For example for 1660C you would go to:
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1660/C
